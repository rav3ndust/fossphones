<h1 style="color:red">PureOS Crimson News</h1>
<!--relevant link: https://puri.sm/posts/pureos-crimson-development-report-march-2025/-->
<p><b>PureOS Crimson</b>, the newest version of Purism's Debian-based GNU/Linux distribution, is making more headway. The Purism team made another post recently outlining some new stuff they've been working on to push the new update forward.</p>
<p><b style="color:red">The latest happenings in Crimson</b></p>
<p>Ten more packages have seen improvements since the last update we got from the PureOS Team.</p>
<p><code>librem5-base</code> is a crucial package for the Librem 5, and it is a critical part of bringing the entire operating system together to create a cohesive experience on the device. Some of the latest improvements to the <code>librem5-base</code> package bring in reliability fixes, deal with related package changes from upstream, and handle fixing partition sizing on the first boot of the device.</p>
<p>Additionally, improvements made to the <code>librem5-flash-image</code> package have simplified for the team to use and maintain it. Another two packages received fixes that were backported from later versions - these include <code>gtk</code> and <code>gnss-share</code>. Still other packages received further fixes and improvements, including <code>millipixels</code>, <code>python-apt</code>, <code>phoc</code>, <code>wlroots-0.16</code>, and <code>osk-sdl</code>.</p>
<p>New updates have also reached both <b>Crimson</b> and <b>Byzantium</b>, which is helpful for Librem 5 owners right now! Updating will get you new fixes, such as <b>Image Viewer</b> now opening the Pictures directory right away, letting users not have to manually open images. There have also been improvements which should make your phone feel more reliable, responsive, and robust.</p>
<p>Fixes are also ready for the next Librem 5 kernel release, which will be reaching both Crimson and Byzantium. Some of the improvements found here include things like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The touchscreen should no longer get stuck with active touches.</li>
	<li>Fast USB chargers providing more than 3 amps will be able to use the full 3 amps supported by the Librem 5, leading to quicker charge times.</li>
	<li>Reading and writing to the internal storage should now be quicker.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Purism team continues to chip away at some issues, testing more functionality with a better foundation with these new changes. The team notes that with all these improvements in the pipeline, we are inching our way closer to an alpha and general release of Crimson, so keep your eyes peeled for news if you use Purism devices!</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Liberux Team Has Prototype Dev Boards in Hand</h1>
<!--relevant link: https://liberux.net/our-first-dev-board-has-arrived/-->
<p>One forthcoming mobile GNU/Linux device we have our eyes on here at FOSSphones is the <a href="https://liberux.net/">Liberux NEXX</a>.</p>
<p>The team behind the device has been at work bringing it to fruition, and recently, they hit a new milestone: they have prototype dev boards in hand.</p>
<p><b style="color:red">The story so far</b></p>
<p>Initially, the Liberux team had faced some challenges prepping for manufacturing the NEXX boards - delays around Chinese New Year and the shutting down of production lines put a damper on things, and to make matters worse, when the team finally got the assembled boards, they found issues such as critical components not being soldered to the board properly. Thankfully, the team found a local company willing to take on the job of manufacturing new NEXX dev boards.</p>
<p>The results of this new partnership were promising, and the Liberux team is now working with this local manufacturer from now on to bring the boards to life.</p>
<p>Since receiving the boards, the electronics team has been working hard to debug the board and get it recognized by a computer. After working through some minor problems, such as misoriented components and soldermask-covered pads, the team reached a big milestone in the journey - communicating with a computer using the processor. A note for the next revision has been documented involving reworking the charging circuit, an issue which has been fixed direclty on the board.</p>
<p>The team notes that this milestone is a big one for one simple fact - they are working with real hardware now, not simply simulations and schematics. The Liberux NEXX is beginning to look more and more like a reality! After checking the board for good assembly, verifying power supply lines, and working on validating the critical components needed, it's time to move onto the next phase of bringing this vision to fruition: generating a functional boot image, so that the team may begin testing the system's peripherals.</p>
<p>The team also notes that they have been working in parallel to build a tool that automates the generation of ARM images for boards based on RK3588 and RK3588S CPUs. This will allow the team to iterate with more speed, and makes it simple to test with similar hardware. Next on the roadmap? Validating peripherals including things like the cameras, the display, flash memory, and the RAM. The Liberux NEXX is beginning to take shape!</p>
<p>Check out some images of the Liberux NEXX dev boards and find out even more by reading <a href="https://liberux.net/our-first-dev-board-has-arrived/">the post</a> shared by the team.</p>

## Wanna help?

Got any ideas for articles about Linux Phones or other FOSS mobile stuff (such as free Android distributions like [LineageOS](https://www.lineageos.org/) or [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/))? Or a piece of FOSS mobile news we might have missed? Found some cool FOSS mobile apps we should know about? Did you notice a typo or a [404](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_404) from one of our pages?

Please feel free to write up an article (*include your name, nickname, and contact handle*) if you want to have it posted on the Gemini and HTTPs versions of FOSSphones. We are always happy to share any content about Linux Phones with the world. Just format your article in HTML or gemtext and send it over through a pull request - I will check it out and merge it. :) 

If you hear about something but don't want to bother with the PR process, just hit us up on the [Fediverse](https://neighborli.xyz/@FOSSphones) or on [X](https://x.com/FSphones) with the information, and we'll get it included in the next FOSSphones roundup!

<h1 style="color:red">Linux Phone News - September 21, 2023</h1>
<p>Hey there, and thanks for stopping by FOSSphones for the latest Linux Phone News Roundup!</p>
<p>There haven't been a ton of new updates the last few weeks, but there are a few things you should be looped in on, including a few announcements from the Purism world and some new software updates you will want to be in the know about.</p>
<p>So, let's dive right in!</p>

<!--new purism tablet-->
<h1 style="color:red">Purism is Dropping a New Tablet</h1>
<p>The company most well-known for their line of Linux-first laptops and smartphones is about to be adding a new product to their lineup - a tablet!</p>
<p>Dubbed the <b>Librem 11</b>, the new tablet from Purism does all of the normal, Librem-y stuff you would expect. It runs Purism's own, Debian-based <b>PureOS</b> out of the box, and comes with PureBoot. If you're curious about the hardware specs, here are some of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Intel N5100 (Jasper Lake) processor</li>
  <li>Intel UHD graphics</li>
  <li>8GB of LPDDR4 soldered RAM</li>
  <li>1TB NVMe (Kingston KC3000) storage</li>
  <li>11.5" AMOLED display</li>
  <li>Two USB-C ports</li>
  <li>3.5mm audio jack, supports headphone-in, mic-out combinations</li>
  <li>Cameras on the front and back of the device</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an exciting time for GNU/Linux on tablets, with a host of hardware options becoming available between the PineTab family, the FydeTab Duo, and now this new entry from Purism, one of the most well-known names in the mobile Linux hardware game.</p>
<p>The tablet will also come with a keyboard that doubles as a protective screen for the device. It attaches through a hard-wired USB connection and doesn't require an extra battery in order to operate.</p>
<p>I have not seen any pricing information on the device, but I will update in a new roundup as soon as that information is available. This looks like another exciting entry into the Linux mobile hardware space, and I am excited to test one out!</p>
<p>If you want to find out more about the Librem 11, please check out the <a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-11/">Librem 11 Purism page</a>!</p>

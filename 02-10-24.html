<h3 style="color:red">Phosh Updates</h3>
<p>If you like the Phosh Shell on your Linux mobile device, you'll be interested in a few updates from the Phosh Team on new developments in the Linux Phone mobile environment.</p>
<p>Looking at the <a href="https://phosh.mobi/posts/phosh-2023-in-retrospect/">2023 wrap-up</a> on the Phosh website, you'll notice some of the nice new features that have been introduced into the software over the last year. These include:</p>

    <li>When you long-press the power button on your device, you will be presented with a menu that gives you quick options to power off the device, lock the display, take a screenshot, or make an emergency call.</li>
    <li>Audio devices are selectable through new quick settings, and ongoing calls display a notification when the display is locked.</li>
    <li>Squeekboard (Phosh's onscreen keyboard), gained new keyboard layouts, saw fixes on sizing, and more.</li>
    <li>The Settings application received a new panel for onscreen keyboard settings. It also received a new censor panel and a panel for configuring event feedback. One can also now configure sounds used when an SMS or phone call is received.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://phosh.mobi/releases/rel-0.35.0/">0.35.0</a> was released on January 7 of this year, and includes some of these nice new changes:</p>

<h3 style="color:red">Mobian: Looking Ahead</h3>
<p>On their blog, the Mobian Team did a <a href="https://blog.mobian.org/posts/2024/01/08/highlights-of-2023/">nice look back</a> at everything they accomplished in 2023, and mentioned some things in the plans for the mobile distribution this year. Here are some of the highlights that we might see coming to Mobian this year:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Bringing in a runtime-based tweaks environment, allowing for unification in images, and packages for hardware that has varying configs and requirements.</li>
    <li>Getting packages that are device-agnostic into Debian.</li>
    <li>Pipewire and Wireplumber improvements, making call audio better.</li>
    <li>Sending more patches upstream.</li>
    <li>Single installer image for mainline Linux devices, avoiding the need to make new per-device installers.</li>
</ul>
<p>For a deeper dive into the roadmap and a look back at the Mobian developments last year, be sure to check out the link above!</p>

<h3 style="color:red">Linux Phone App Highlight</h3>
<p>I want to start highlighting some of the apps I have been using in each update to shine a spotlight on them, and the devs building them. As such, we will begin highlighting some apps in our roundups!</p>
<ul>
    <li><b>WatchMate</b>: I use a PineTime, and this app is great for connecting to my PinePhone. Not only does it handle the Bluetooth connection to the device, but it also can handle downloading and installing firmware updates for PineTime operating systems, such as InfiniTime! Check out WatchMate on <a href="https://linuxphoneapps.org/apps/io.gitlab.azymohliad.watchmate/">Flathub</a> and give it a go!</li>
    <li><b>Fractal</b>: On GNOME-based environments, I like to use Fractal for my Matrix conversations. I use Matrix to talk to several friends and family members, and run some groups, including the FOSSphones community group. On mobile Linux devices, Fractal scales nicely to the mobile environment. If you want a nice Matrix client for your device, give Fractal a go <a href="https://linuxphoneapps.org/apps/org.gnome.fractal/">here</a>.</li>
    <li><b>Blanket</b>: A great application for making some background sounds. You can relax with sounds of nature and customize it to your liking. I like to run this app in the background sometimes while working on other things. If this sounds like something you'd enjoy, check out Blanket <a href="https://linuxphoneapps.org/apps/com.rafaelmardojai.blanket/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Do you have any favorite applications to use on your Linux Phone? If so, please shout it out to us on the Fediverse, on Twitter, or in the FOSSphones Community group, and we will be sure to write it up in our next roundup!</p>

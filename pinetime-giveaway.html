<p>So, you want to win yourself a <b>PineTime</b>? To enter our PineTime giveaway contest, it is very simple. All you need to do to enter is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write us a short blurb or make a video about why you think free and open-source software is important for users and for the world as a whole.</li>
<li>Your content doesn't need to be long, 300-500 words is fine. Just enough to explain why you think FOSS has value. If you don't feel like writing something up, you can always make a video, upload it to YouTube or Odysee, and tag it using the hashtag <b><i>#fossphonesgiveaway</i></b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will look through each and every submission, and the best one will receive a brand new PineTime flashed with the newest version of InfiniTime. The winning submission will also be featured right here on <b>FOSSphones</b>, where FOSS enthusiasts from all over the world will be able to check out the winner's content.</p>
<p>The <b>FOSSphones PineTime Giveaway</b> contest will begin on <u>April 30</u> and will go on until <u>May 15</u>. That gives everyone plenty of time to get in their submissions. When the contest is closed, we will go over all the submissions, choose the best one, and get in touch with the winner so we will know where to ship your PineTime.</p>
<h3 style="color:red">I'm in! Where do I send my submission?</h3>

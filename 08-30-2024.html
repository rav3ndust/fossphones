<h1 style="color:red">Linux Phone News - August 30, 2024</h1>
<p>Greetings, all, and welcome to  your August edition of the news roundup! Unfortunately due to some personal things, including a death in the family and dealing with a bad wisdom tooth, I have not been able to do the July roundup. Therefore, this roundup will cover some of what has been going on both this month, and in July.</p>
<p>Aside from a few notable updates, the last little bit has been a little sparse on major news in the way of mobile free software news - but we're going to cover the highlights, as we always do!</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Purism and Abside Collaborate to Bring Secure Phones to the US Government and NATO</h1>
<p>Purism, the maker of the free software mobile device, the Librem 5, is partnering up with Abside, a provider of secure networking solutions made in the USA. This collaboration aims to bring secure mobile devices to the US government and NATO countries.</p>
<p>Besides making use of the "Liberty Phone", which is simply Purism's name for the Librem 5 produced in the United States, the collaboration also brings Abside's N79 5G network, which is meant specifically to be used by the government in the USA.</p>
<p>The goal of the partnership is provide a secure device and mobile network for governmental use through the Abside network and Purism's devices running PureOS.</p>
<p>Here is a further breakdown of the goals of the partnership:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Enhanced security through the Abside N79 network.</li>
	<li>Enhanced privacy in communication using the Librem 5's features, which include its physical killswitches.</li>
	<li>Achive compliance by meeting security requirements for US governmental and NATO countries.</li>
</ul>

<h1 style="color:red">Update on PureOS 'Crimson' Development</h1>
<p>Speaking of PureOS, Purism recently put out a new update on the development status of PureOS, the OS that powers its Librem line of laptops and smartphones.</p>
<p>Let's take a quick look at some of the highlights to see what the team has been up to!</p>
<p>There are currently a few issues blocking the team from a final release, but they are working on it. This includes some dependency problems and syncing packages from Debian Bookworm to PureOS Crimson. A few breakdown of these issues:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Dependencies</b>: There are 4,766 dependencies in the way right now, which does sound like quite a bit, but it comes down to a few key packages. A good majority of it comes from a <code>linux-libc-dev</code> dependency. PureOS Crimson currently doesn't import the Debian package needed for arm64 thanks to an interaction with the Librem 5 kernel package. When the team is finished addressing this issue, they expect the number to come down considerably.</li>
	<li><b>Sync</b>: Sometimes, when a package is modified in PureOS, it won't properly sync anymore due to needed integration with changes in Debian. While there aren't currently a ton of issues with sync, a few of them are currently difficult to integrate. Some of these issues can happen thanks to complex packages downstream in PureOS, changes may have been done upstream in Debian, or sometimes, both.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also work ongoing to improve <b>ModemManager</b>. Signal strength that isn't needed tends to consume a good bit of battery while polling. This is especially true on the Librem 5 devices thanks to the activity in the USB hub. It also applies to all other QMI modems that don't require signal strength polling. However, team member Sebastian fixed the issue and sent the fix upstream to the FreeDesktop Team, and it has been merged.</p>
<p>While this wasn't an issue in the current version of PureOS (Byzantium), a change in 2022 from upstream enabled polling all the time - the Purism Team took care of this on their end.</p>
<p>If you would like to help fund the development of the new version of PureOS, you can also contribute with a <a href="https://puri.sm/posts/pureos-optional-subscription-added-to-advance-development/">PureOS Subscription</a>, recently announced by Purism to help advance the development of the operating system.</p>

<h1 style="color:red">LineageOS 18.1 is Sunsetting</h1>
<p>Speaking of AOSP distributions, there is some news from the world of LineageOS, as well. While most users are probably up-to-date to LineageOS 21 (as I currently am on my Moto z3 and my Essential Phone), users on older devices might still be using some of the older versions of LineageOS.</p>
<p>With that being said, LineageOS 18.1 just saw its final update. Going forward, LOS 18.1 will be considered sunset. This is due to the fact that in February, Google published the final ASB (Android Security Bulletin) for Android 11, the version of Android on which LineageOS 18.1 is based on.</p>
<p>The Lineage team clarifies that while backports could technically be done, it would very difficult for changes across versions to be tracked - and the worry that backporting the code to fix security vulnerabilities on this older version could introduce newer vulnerabilities in the process.</p>
<p>If your device is currently running 18.1, be sure to see if it is still supported by LineageOS. If it isn't, you can always grab a device which is supported by current versions, or you could see if development for your device starts up again - or you could always take up the mantle for yourself!</p>
<p>If you want further details on the sunsetting of LineageOS 18.1, be sure to check <a href="https://lineageos.org/Sunsetting-LineageOS-18.1/">the announcement</a> from the LineageOS team to get the full scoop.</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Linux Phone App Highlight</h1>
<p>As usual, we have a few free software mobile apps to spotlight. If this is your first roundup, we share a few of our favorite apps on Linux phones and AOSP devices each time, in the hopes that more people learn about them.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/corewala.gemini.buran/">Buran</a>: Buran is an Android app great for AOSP devices. It is a dedicated mobile web browser for the Gemini protocol, and can be customised and tweaked in various ways. I like finding and reading new Gemini capsules, and I find myself opening this app frequently for my Gemini browsing.</li>
    <li><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.vitorpamplona.amethyst/">Amethyst</a>: Another application for AOSP, this is a client app for the Nostr protocol. <a href="nostr.com">Nostr</a> is a newer decentralised social networking protocol, and it has been a lot of fun to use and build on over the last couple of years. I might do a bigger writeup into Nostr someday, but it is quite simple - your identity is managed by a private and public key, much like a crypto wallet. If you want to check it out, Amethyst is a great client app for the protocol.</li>
    <li><a href="https://flathub.org/apps/dev.geopjr.Tuba">Tuba</a>: Tuba is a GTK application for accessing Fediverse instances (things in the ActivityPub family, such as Mastodon and Pleroma). The app is well-designed, and it allows you to create posts, interact with others' posts, and other things you would expect to do with your favorite Fediverse client apps. Being GTK based, it also blends well in GNOME-based environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, if you have any recommendations for FOSS mobile apps you like and use frequently, tell us about it on the Fediverse or X, and we will be sure to highlight them in a future roundup!</p>

<p>That's about it for this first April roundup! As usual, thanks for stopping in and checking out what's new in the latest in the world of Linux and free software on mobile devices. Until next time, we hope everyone has a great week, and we'll see you in the next roundup!</p>

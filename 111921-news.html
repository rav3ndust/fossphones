<h1 style="color:red">Sxmo 1.6.0 Brings Wayland Support</h1>
<p>I have made my admiration for the "suckless" mobile distro, <b>Sxmo</b> quite public, and I am happy to say that they have delivered another great release.</p>
<p>This release, however, isn't your typical release with just a few bugfixes and an added feature or two - nope, this one brings support for Wayland!</p>
<p><b>Sway</b> becomes the default window manager in this release of Sxmo, but don't worry if you prefer <b>dwm</b> - Sxmo still supports it, and it can be easily installed with the following command:</p>
<code>apk add postmarketos-ui-sxmo-dwm</code>
<p>You can have both <b>sway</b> and <b>dwm</b> installed at the same time, and be able to easily switch between them through the distro's built in config menu.</p>
<p>Other exciting features in this release include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A rework of the screenlock.</li>
    <li>Proper MMS support!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can upgrade your Sxmo installation with the following command:</p>
<code>apk update && apk upgrade -a</code>
<p>Enjoy the cool new features and Wayland support!</p>
<p>You can visit <a href="https://lists.sr.ht/~mil/sxmo-announce/%3C31IGOQIT71NT5.2LYA6VY1SCLPK%40stacyharper.net%3E">the project's sourcehut</a> to learn more about the update for yourself!</p>

<p>For folks like me who try to stay up to date on the latest happenings directly in relation to the PinePhone, PineTime, PineTab, and other Pine64 devices, the best place to find the information is right from Pine64 themselves.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the highlights:</p>
<ul>
    <li>PinePhone Pro dev pre-orders have been closed, and coupons should be being issues soon.</li>
    <li>The PinePhone keyboard attachment is due out in December! I can't wait to get my hands on one of these and test it out - will be sure to report back here after I am able to obtain one.</li>
    <li>Discussion around the new SOQuartz board and PineDio were also included, along with some updates on PineTime and InfiniTime.</li>
</ul>

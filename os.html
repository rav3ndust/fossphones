<h3>Operating Systems</h3>
<p>If you’re just getting started out with Linux phones like the PinePhone, then of course you’re going to be looking for operating systems you can test and tinker with to your heart’s content.</p>
<p>Remember, not many of these mobile distributions are going to be considered “daily-driver” ready for most people just yet, but you can still flash it to an SD card and give it a go!</p>
<p>If you want to learn about a certain operating system, just click on it and you’ll learn a bit about its background, what it does best, and where you can download it for yourself.</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Community</h1>
<p>I had originally set up a <b>Discourse</b> instance for FOSSphones not long ago, but then I realized I had an even better option already available.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to build up a forum, why not just set up some simple communication channels using software that folks in the FOSS space are already using?</p>
<p>Naturally, <b>Matrix</b> and <b>xmpp</b> were the first things to jump to mind. I now have an <b>Element Space</b> set up on Matrix.</p>
<p>Anyone is free to come join in and talk about the latest in Linux Phones, projects, software, and anything else we feel like discussing.</p>
<p><i>We already have a few people hanging out in the Matrix room, stop by and say hi sometime if you would like!</i></p>
<p><b>Here are the community channels I am getting together for FOSSphones.</b></p>

Do we want to make an xmpp server for fossphones?

Something to consider - I am also thinking about making an IRC server for fossphones. we'll see what happens.

<h3 style="color:red">FOSSphones on XMPP</h3>
<p>I have been thinking about also making an XMPP server for FOSSphones. I don't have this setup yet, but I will post it here as soon as I do it...</p>
<p><i>...if/when I do, of course :)</i></p>

<h3 style="color:red">FOSSphones on IRC</h3>
<p>Naturally, we have to be cool and have an IRC channel up and running! I'm going to be working on this at some point this week when I have some free time.</p>
<p>With a FOSSphones IRC channel, the goal would be for someone to be able to pop in and get help anytime they have a question or trouble with their Linux/DeGoogled phones.</p>
<p>As soon as I have the channel up and running, I will post updates here.</p>

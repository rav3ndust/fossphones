<!--relevant link: https://puri.sm/posts/pureos-crimson-august-2025-alpha-released/ -->
<p>The Purism team has announced that they have closed their <a href="https://source.puri.sm/groups/pureos/-/milestones/1">first milestone</a> and released alpha images for PureOS Crimson to all Librem devices. This means you can now test out the new version of PureOS on your own devices if you'd like to see what new changes are coming around the corner, test out the images, and let the PureOS Team know about any issues you encounter so they can get them fixed!</p>
<p>The docs for each device are as follows:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://docs.puri.sm/Software/PureOS/Installation.html">Installation instructions</a> for the Librem 13, Librem 14, Librem 15, and Librem Mini</li>
	<li><a href="https://docs.puri.sm/Hardware/Librem_5/Maintenance/Reflashing.html">Reflashing instructions</a> for the Librem 5</li>

<p>A few known issues have already been fixed, including two bugs affecting Firefox, updating the Librem 5 kernel to Linux 6.6.101, and a fix for the first-run-setup's fit on small displays. If you have installed the alpha, you can update your system and receive these latest changes and fixes.</p>
<p>Purism notes that the goal of this alpha is to make sure that OS essential functionality works, and through community testing the team can identify and fix any bugs before customers encounter them. The next milestone for PureOS Crimson is going to be the beta, where the team notes that you will be able to upgrade from PureOS Byzantium without requiring a reflash. Major functionality is expected to work in the beta, and users will be able to update directly to the general release from the beta, as well.</p>

<h1 style="color:red">Pine64 Showcases the Movuan Project</h1>
<!--relevant link: https://pine64.org/2025/08/27/august_2025_movuan/ -->
<p>In a late August project showcase, Pine64 provided a spotlight to the <a href="https://gitlab.com/l2385/movuan">Movuan</a> project. Being forked from Mobian, this project aims to be for mobile what Devuan is for desktop - an alternative for distributions using the <code>systemd</code> init system.</p>
<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://www.devuan.org/">Devuan</a> is a fork of Debian, providing alternative init systems such as <code>sysvinit</code> (the default), <code>openrc</code>, <code>runit</code>, <code>s6</code>, and others. This is a personal preference for people who prefer not to use SystemD, and for all practical purposes, other than its alternative init systems, you'll find the Devuan and Movuan look and run largely the same as Debian and Mobian.</p>
<p>Movuan was started by Pine64 community member lxb, and announced in a <a href="https://dev1galaxy.org/viewtopic.php?id=7094">forum post</a>. As a Mobian fork, it uses modified versions of Mobian's <code>debos</code> to build its images. There is also an optional script that can provide extra software to customize a Movuan image, including <b>AndroidImpEx</b> for importing contacts and SMS messages from an Android device, Ungoogled Chromium, and more.</p>
<p>At the moment, the Movuan project offers images based on Devuan 5.0 (which is in turn based on Debian 12) with the Phosh mobile desktop environment. Images can be found in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/l2385/movuan/movuan-recipes/-/releases">project's Gitlab</a>, along with <a href="https://gitlab.com/l2385/movuan/movuan-recipes#install">installation instructions</a>. If you'd like, you can also build your own image using <a href="https://gitlab.com/l2385/movuan/movuan-recipes#prepare-your-build-system">the debos recipe</a>.</p>
<p>In the future, Movuan hopes to merge with upstream Devuan as an official version, but this will require some work and polish before it can happen. To help Movuan in this regard, packaging and testing assistance is needed. If you'd like to offer a helping hand to Movuan, <a href="mailto:lxb1@yahoo.com">get in touch with lxb</a>!</p>

<h1 style="color:red">FOSSphones App Highlights</h1>
<!--FOSSphones App Highlights.-->
<!--Every roundup, we try to highlight at least 3 FOSS apps we've been using on mobile.
These should always be different each months so we're not highlighting the same apps each time.
It is okay to highlight the same app again if it has seen some big updates lately.-->
<p>If you've been a long-time FOSSphones reader, then you'll know that every roundup we cover some of the FOSS mobile apps we've been using on either mainline Linux phones, or on AOSP operating systems such as LineageOS. As usual, we've got another three to cover this month that I've been testing out!</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.github.lamarios.clipious/">Clipious</a>: A client for Invidious, which is a privacy-focused frontend to Youtube. It has livestream support, the ability to use either public servers or your own, background playback enabled, user playlists, an Android TV UI, video/audio download, and more! If you like to use Invidious clients on your desktop, you might find this mobile-focused version to be a helpful tool.</li>
	<li><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.b44t.messenger/">Delta Chat</a>: Delta Chat is a unique decentralized instant messenger using email as its backend. It supports end-to-end encryption and can work with existing email accounts or special chatmail accounts for enhanced privacy. It is extensible, and tools like shopping lists, calendars, or gaming apps can be added to chats. It also supports multiple chat profiles, and can be setup on as many devices as you wish.</li>
	<li><a href="https://f-droid.org/en/packages/org.wesnoth.Wesnoth/">Battle For Wesnoth</a>: Battle For Wesnoth is a game you might be familiar with on your Linux desktop (I love playing it!). This release on F-Droid for mobile is currently in alpha, so if you have ever wanted to play the game on the go, now is your chance to shine! If you've never played it, Battle For Wesnoth is a turn-based strategy game with roots in fantasy. You can play single-player, or online multiplayer with friends.</li>
</ul>
<p>Know of any cool open-source mobile apps we've not covered here before, or one that's been updated that we haven't covered in awhile? If you're using or developing a FOSS mobile app, please reach out to us and let us know about it so we can highlight it here!</p>
<div class="breakHelper">

</div>
<p>It's been a great last month full of some new releases, and great to see a new mobile Linux device entering the fray! The constant evolution of mobile distributions and the expansion of devices capable of running Linux is only going to continue to strengthen the capabilities of mobile Linux, bringing in more interest from devs and users alike.</p>
<p>That about wraps our September FOSSphones news roundup, and we will see you in the next one! Until then, hope you have a spectacular beginning of October as we close the books on this month.</p>
